API Powered App Project: http://igm.rit.edu/~cavigm/430/

The goal of this project was to create a simple webpage that would be able to store a user’s name, their favorite coffee, their favorite coffee shop, a description of the coffee itself, the coffee’s price and the rating of that coffee. 

I implemented my application so that a user can input different types of information including their name, favorite type of coffee, favorite coffee shop, a description of that coffee, the price, and overall rating of the coffee. This information is then converted into JSON data and able to be output to the user in a readable format.
